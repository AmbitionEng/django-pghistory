## How does `django-pghistory` track everything?

By using [Postgres triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html). In other words, historical event records are created in the database alongside the database operation, providing a reliable way to track events regardless of where it happens in your code.

## Are triggers supported by Django?

Triggers are not supported by Django directly, but `django-pghistory` uses [django-pgtrigger](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgtrigger) to seamlessly integrate them with your Django models.

## How do I know triggers are working?

For those that are new to triggers and want additional confidence in their behavior, try the following:

* Always write tests. Perform updates on your tracked models in automated tests and verify that the event models are created.
* Run `python manage.py pgtrigger ls` to verify that all triggers are installed.
* Run `python manage.py check` to ensure that there are no missing migrations for triggers.

## What are the performance impacts?

Although triggers will be issuing additional SQL statements to write events, keep in mind that this happens within the database instance itself. In other words, writing events does not incur additional expensive round-trip database calls. This results in a reduced performance impact when compared to other history tracking methods implemented in software.

Note that currently `django-pghistory` uses row-level triggers, meaning a bulk update such as `Model.objects.update` over one hundred elements could perform one hundred queries within the database instance. We're planning to address this in a future version of `django-pghistory` by using statement-level triggers instead. See the [discussion here in django-pgtrigger](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgtrigger/discussions/166).

See the [Performance and Scaling](performance.md) section for tips and tricks on large history tables.

## How do I associate the logged-in user with history?

By using [Context Tracking](context.md). `django-pghistory` comes with a middleware that automatically enables it and tracks the URL and logged-in user of the request.

## How do I revert models?

Check out the [Reverting Objects](reversion.md) section.

## How do I conditionally track history?

Add a condition to your tracker to only track history when certain events occur. See the [Conditional Tracking](event_tracking.md#conditional_tracking) subsection.

## How do I track models with concrete inheritance?

`django-pghistory` simply snapshots the fields on the underlying table, meaning you'll need to set up trackers on all inherited tables. We plan to make this easier in the future.

When tracking child models, remember to set proper reverse foreign key names, otherwise collisions can happen. For example:

``` python
@pghistory.track()
class Parent(models.Model):
    field_a = models.CharField(default="unknown")


@pghistory.track()
class Child(Parent):
    field_b = models.CharField(default="unknown")
```

These models will raise the following:
```
mmp_metadata.ChildEvent.pgh_obj: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor 'Child.events' for 'mmp_metadata.ChildEvent.pgh_obj' clashes with reverse accessor for 'mmp_metadata.ParentEvent.pgh_obj'.
        HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'mmp_metadata.ChildEvent.pgh_obj' or 'mmp_metadata.ParentEvent.pgh_obj'.
mmp_metadata.ChildEvent.pgh_obj: (fields.E305) Reverse query name for 'mmp_metadata.ChildEvent.pgh_obj' clashes with reverse query name for 'mmp_metadata.ParentEvent.pgh_obj'.
        HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'mmp_metadata.ChildEvent.pgh_obj' or 'mmp_metadata.ParentEvent.pgh_obj'.
```

This error is due to multiple foreign keys having the same 'default' name. Manually set the relation and query names to avoid this clash.

``` python
@pghistory.track(
    obj_field=pghistory.ObjForeignKey(
        related_name="parent_event",
        related_query_name="parent_event_query",
    )
)
class Parent(models.Model):
    field_a = models.CharField(default="unknown")


@pghistory.track(
    obj_field=pghistory.ObjForeignKey(
        related_name="child_event",
        related_query_name="child_event_query",
    )
)
class Child(Parent):
    field_b = models.CharField(default="unknown")
```

## Can my event models be cascade deleted?

By default, event models use unconstrained foreign keys and instruct Django to do nothing when tracked models are deleted. This applies not only to the `pgh_obj` field that maintains a reference to the tracked model, but every foreign key that's tracked.

You can configure the `pgh_obj` key globally by setting the `settings.PGHISTORY_OBJ_FIELD` with the proper configuration or by setting it on a per-event-model basis with the `obj_field` option to [pghistory.track][].

See the [Configuring Event Models](event_models.md) section for details on how to set configuration options for event models.

## How can I make my event models immutable?

Use `append_only=True` for [pghistory.track][] or set `settings.PGHISTORY_APPEND_ONLY = True` to configure this as the default behavior globally. When configured, event models will have triggers that protect updates and deletes from happening, ensuring your event log is immutable.

## Can I query event models in my application?

Yes, one of the strengths of `django-pghistory` is that it uses structured event models that can be tailored to fit your application use case. By default, you can use `my_model_object.events` to query events of a particular model instance. `MyModel.pgh_event_model` also contains a reverence to the event model if you want to do table-level filtering over the events.

## How can I keep the values of fields that have been removed?

The short answer is that you can't. `django-pghistory` is designed to create event models that mirror the models they track, meaning the removal of a field in a tracked model will also be removed in the event model.

If you need data for fields that have been dropped, we recommend two approaches:

1. Make the field nullable instead of removing it.
2. Use [django-pgtrigger](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgtrigger) to create a custom trigger that dumps a JSON record of the row at that point in time.

## I'm getting `function _pgh_attach_context() does not exist`

If you don't run migrations in your test suite, pghistory's custom context tracking function won't be installed. Set `PGHISTORY_INSTALL_CONTEXT_FUNC_ON_MIGRATE=True` in your test settings.

!!! note

    This is harmless to enable in all environments, but it will issue a redundant SQL statement after running `migrate`.

## How can I backfill events?

You may want to backfill events for data that's already in the database. One approach is to use the [manual event tracking](event_tracking.md#manual_tracking) feature to manually create tracking events. Remember to use the actual model class instead of the fake migration model.

For large backfills, consider bulk creating events. Get the event model by importing the model in your migration and referencing `model.pgh_event_model` (or `model.pgh_event_models["label"]` if there's more than one).

Consider opening a pull request if you'd like to contribute a more comprehensive backfill example to the docs or a top-level `backfill` function in the interface to help facilitate this.

## Are composite primary keys supported?

Not at the moment. We plan to support tracking models with composite primary keys when Django supports foreign keys to these models.

## How can I report issues or request features

Open a [discussion](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pghistory/discussions) for a feature request. You're welcome to pair this with a pull request, but it's best to open a discussion first if the feature request is not trivial.

For bugs, open an [issue](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pghistory/issues).
